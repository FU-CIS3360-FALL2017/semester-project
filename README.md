# Semester Project
## Instructions
When you have accepted the invitation to this assignment in GitHub, you will have a private repository for your semester project owned by your instructor and with you as a collaborator. You should clone that repository to your workstation and add the work you have done on your semester project to it by adding to the index.html file and by creating other files that your project requires.  

After you have accepted the invitation and received your repository, I will set the default web address to your master branch so that you and I can simply click on the link on the main repository page in GitHub for testing. 
## Submission
From your cloned copy of your semester repository you should push changes in your project to the GitHub copy of the repository at reasonable intervals of time. As that is happening your should create Pull Requests for the GitHub repository for my intermittent input along the way. When the time limit comes for your completing the project I will give a grade based on what I see in the master branch of your semester project repository.
